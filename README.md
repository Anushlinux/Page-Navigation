**Description**

This is a basic Flutter project demonstrating navigation between screens: a First Page and a Second Page and a App drawer. It uses the MaterialApp widget as the main application and defines routes for navigating between the pages.

**Features**

- Simple navigation between two screens
- App bar with title and background color
- Drawer on the First Page
- Button on the Second Page to navigate back to the First Page

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-app.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the ZIP file from your GitHub repository and extract it.
3. **Run the App**

**Folder Structure**

```
myapp/
  lib/
    main.dart               # Entry point of the application
    pages/
      first_page.dart        # Defines the First Page widget
      second_page.dart       # Defines the Second Page widget
  pubspec.yaml             # Project configuration file
```

**Code Overview**

- `main.dart`: This file is the entry point of the application. It creates a `MyApp` widget using the `runApp` function.
- `first_page.dart`: This file defines the `firstPage` widget, which represents the First Page of the app.
- `second_page.dart`: This file defines the `secondPage` widget, which represents the Second Page of the app.

**Navigation**

The app uses named routes to navigate between the First Page and the Second Page. The `routes` property in the `MaterialApp` widget defines these routes:

- `/firstPage`: This route leads to the `firstPage` widget.
- `/secondPage`: This route leads to the `secondPage` widget.
